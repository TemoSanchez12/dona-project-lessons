# Basic Programming: Variables and Arithmetic Operations

## Assignment: Simple Calculator

### Objective

In this assignment, you will create a simple program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using variables. This will help you understand how to declare and use variables in a programming language.

### Instructions

1. **Declare Variables:**  
   Create two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them any integer values of your choice.

2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations:**  
   Write code that performs the following operations on `num1` and `num2`:

   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

3. **Display Results:**  
   Print the results of each operation to the console. The output should clearly show which operation was performed and the result. For example:
