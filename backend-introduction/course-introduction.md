## What is Backend Development?

Backend development refers to the server-side development of web applications. It focuses on databases, servers, APIs, and everything that happens behind the scenes to process requests and serve responses.

Backend development is responsible for:

- Managing user requests
- Handling data processing
- Communicating with the database
- Ensuring the application runs smoothly on the server

## Common Backend Technologies

There are several programming languages and frameworks used in backend development. Some popular ones include:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Python (Django/Flask)**: Known for simplicity and readability.
- **Ruby on Rails**: A server-side web application framework written in Ruby.
- **ASP.NET**: A framework for building web apps and services with .NET.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before starting, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the basic steps to get started with **Node.js**:

1. Install **Node.js** from the official website [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
